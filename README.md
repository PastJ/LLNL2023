| Task | Description |
|----- |-------------|
|Task 1 - Healthy vs Irregular Heart Beat Classification | Binary classification of healthy vs irregular heart rhythms from ECG data using Random Forest, SVM, and KNN  [Task 1 Code](https://github.com/PastJ/LLNL2023/blob/main/Task1.ipynb)|
|Task 2 - Multi-class Healthy vs Irregular Heart Beat Classification | Multi-class classification of healthy vs irregular heart rhythms from ECG data using Random Forest, SVM, and KNN  [Task 2 Code](https://github.com/PastJ/LLNL2023/blob/main/Task2.ipynb)|
|Task 3 - Reconstruction of activation map given ECG leads| Sequence-to-vector prediction of voltage start recordings and ECG Signals to perform activation map reconstruction (i.e. transform 12x500 standard leads recordings to a 75x1 activation map using a neural network) with TensorFlow [Task 3 Code](https://github.com/PastJ/LLNL2023/blob/main/Task3.ipynb)|
|Task 4 - Reconstruction of transmembrane potential given ECG leads| Sequence-to-vector prediction of entire voltage recordings and ECG Signals to perform activation map reconstruction (i.e. transform 12x500 standard leads recordings to a 75x500 activation map using a neural network) with PyTorch [Task 4 Code](https://github.com/PastJ/LLNL2023/blob/main/Task4.ipynb)|
